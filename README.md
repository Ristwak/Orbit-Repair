# Suit Up VR

Suit Up VR is an interactive virtual reality learning experience that teaches players how astronauts prepare for space missions. The game takes place inside a virtual spacecraft environment and guides players through the correct sequence of putting on a space suit, layer by layer, with full interactivity.

## Features
- Step-by-step dressing sequence: cooling garment, main suit, gloves, helmet, and life support backpack
- Interactive 3D environment with guided narration
- Real-time feedback for correct and incorrect actions
- Mini zero-gravity simulation challenge after dressing
- Quiz and reflection prompts to reinforce learning
- Completion rewards such as digital badges and recap of progress

## Educational Goals
- Demonstrate the importance of each space suit component
- Show the correct sequence of dressing for astronaut safety
- Provide an immersive introduction to astronaut training and preparation
- Inspire students to learn more about space science and exploration

## Project Structure
- **Scripts**: Core game logic including GameManager, SuitStep, InteractionHandler, and UIManager
- **Scenes**: VR spacecraft environment for dressing and mission simulation
- **UI**: Objective display, feedback messages, and quiz system
- **Assets**: Placeholder objects for early testing, to be replaced with 3D suit models

## Requirements
- Unity 2021.3 LTS or later
- XR Interaction Toolkit
- VR headset support (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, or other OpenXR compatible devices)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the project in Unity  
3. Import XR Interaction Toolkit if not already included  
4. Play in VR mode to test interactions with placeholder objects  
5. Replace placeholder objects with final suit models when available  

## Roadmap
- Implement full 3D models of the space suit components
- Add hand tracking support for zipping and attaching parts
- Expand quiz system with more educational questions
- Add fun facts about astronauts and space suits
- Optimize user experience for classroom learning
